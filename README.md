========

This is the GitHub page for **Demigods**, a full RPG experience designed to create a unique team-building game for survival/PvP servers.

Not to be confused with other RPG plugins that focus on skills and classes alone- this adds culture and conflict that will keep players coming back after they've maxed out their other levels and found all the diamond deposits in a 50 km radius. Demigods is unique in its system of rewarding players for both adventuring (tributes) and conquering (PvP) with a wide array of fun and useful skills. Re-enact mythological battles and rise from a Demigod to a fully fledged Olympian as you ally yourself with the Gods, Titans, and other alliances in the battle to the bitter end!

Installation
============

To install, simply place the Demigods.jar in to your plugins folder and run the server. That's it. Everything else is handled automatically.
